When I saw the I'll Serve Soup project it reminded me of the work of my Great Uncle Charles "Sweet Daddy" Grace when he opened soup kitchens and showed churches all over the country how to survive and rebuild their communities without government assistance.  His soup kitchen based programs raised $25 million that provided jobs, homes, food, and clothes for thousands of Americans and he pioneered many of the earliest interracial churches.  I hoped to use the project to spread the inspiration of what a determined, cohesive community can do to strengthen themselves and also bless their hungry neighbors of other races.</p>
